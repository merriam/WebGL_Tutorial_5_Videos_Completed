WebGL Tutorials from Videos
============

These are tutorials from following videos
from Indigo Code.

### Lesson 1: Introduction and Triangle
* Video is 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kB0ZVUrI4Aw
* My code does two triangles with one on top
of the other with a gradient.
* Open *l1/index.html* to view it. 

### Lesson 2:  
* My code does a rotating cube, in *l2/index.html*
* It uses *gl-matrix.js*, a library file, for the matrix manipulation.

### Lesson 3:
* This needs to be run within a web browser. 
  * If you open in plain Chrome, you will get a "DOM Exception... Cross Origin..."
  * Explained in the video around 20:00.
  * Run *python -m http.server 8000* then *open 0.0.0.0:8000*
* It shows a rotating cube with a crate texture map.
* Video is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpnd11doMgc
* *crate.png* is a flat image of the side of crate.
* *gl-matrix.js* is a library as last time.
